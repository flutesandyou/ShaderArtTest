This is test assignment from instories.

usage:
Open workspace in VS Code
ShaderArtTest.code-workspace

Use glsl-canvas VS Code estension
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circledev.glsl-canvas

Press Shift+P, type Show glslCanvas

notes:
I used consts for params instead of uniforms just for convenience
IO buffers are buggy and FBO's aren't supported in glsl-canvas vs code extension so I didn't implement off-screen passes to calc edge detection.
